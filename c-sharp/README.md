### Task 1 - Fix some ugly code ###

Imagine yourself working at Joke Companyâ„¢. This company has an app that gets random Chuck Norris jokes and can substitute other peoples names into the joke instead of Chuck Norris'.

Your task as a professional developer is to clean up this app and make it something you can be proud of.

*Note: This is NOT a representation of our codebase to be clear. We did have fun crafting this beauty however ;)*

### Task 2 - Write a report ###

Write a document explaining some of the improvements you made to the code, and why you did so.

Everything is included in the PR Description, ChangeLog and Commit history.

### What do I need? ###

* [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) - any platform

### Who do I talk to? ###

If you have any questions you can email careers@geotab.com
